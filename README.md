## To use ss-pipe with AWS and Github Actions

### Setting up AWS and Github Actions

> Most of this part is from this documentation [link](https://github.com/claudiacachayosorio/demo-gifs#installation)

#### AWS Setup

1. First create an S3 bucket with "Block Public Access" setting disabled. In IAM console create a new policy using this [template](https://gist.github.com/myusf01/3146258b08fc2ad8ab33bc6cd7e48d60). Be sure change `BUCKET_NAME` to your S3 bucket's name.
2. Then create a new user by your new policy assigned.
3. Then you should create a AWS S3 bucket with sth....

#### Generator Setup

1. Fork this repository.
2. In repository settings create two secrets names as `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` by assigning IAM credentials to them.
3. Then change these lines in workflows.
4. > `aws-region: eu-central-1` to your S3 bucket region
5. > `[...] s3://mysf-sspipe --acl public-read --cache-control no-cache` change name to your buckets name.

#### Project Setup

This settings are for the project you want to take screenshot or record GIF.

1. Get any dispatcher template from `/template-workflow` folder and add file to your `/.github/workflows` folder.
2. Then create a personal access token in GitHub Developer settings with repo and workflow permissions.
3. Create a secret for your project named FLOW_TOKEN and add your token.

> ðŸ“Œ
>
> You should set Cache-Control to no-cache in metadata otherwise Github will use cached image.
> So that linked image will not be updated in README file.

> ðŸ“Œ
>
> Be sure to your `package.json` have `name` and `homepage` fields filled.
> Workflow will use `name` to name the file and `homepage` to get link totake shot.
